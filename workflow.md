# Workflow for Issue #202: Add mobile vault lock detail screen design

This document outlines the steps to resolve issue #202.

## 1. Understand the Existing Vault Feature

- Review the existing code related to the vault feature to understand its current implementation.
- Affected files:
  - `app/(tabs)/vault.tsx`
  - `src/components/VaultLockList.tsx`
  - `src/store/vaultStore.ts`
  - `src/features/vault/`

## 2. Create Mock Data for Vault Locks

- Create a new mock data file for vault locks to be used for UI development, as per the issue's suggestion.
- This will likely be in `tests/fixtures/`.

## 3. Create the Vault Lock Detail Screen

- Create a new screen file for the vault lock detail view. A suitable location would be `app/vault/[id].tsx` to follow the existing routing patterns.
- This screen will fetch the lock details based on the ID from the route.

## 4. Develop the UI Component for Lock Details

- Create a reusable React component `VaultLockDetail.tsx` in `src/components/`.
- This component will display:
  - Amount
  - Created Date
  - Unlock Date
  - Status
  - Withdrawal Eligibility
  - Related Actions (e.g., a "Withdraw" button)
- The design should be consistent with the existing application's theme and components.

## 5. Integrate Navigation

- Update the `VaultLockList.tsx` component to navigate to the new detail screen when a lock item is pressed.
- Pass the lock ID as a parameter during navigation.

## 6. Handle Edge Cases

- Ensure the detail screen gracefully handles cases where lock data is missing or unavailable. This might involve showing a loading state or an error message.

## 7. Final Review

- Review the implementation against the acceptance criteria in the issue.
- Ensure the new screen is well-designed and the code follows project conventions.
